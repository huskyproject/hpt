BUG-REPORTING
-------------

Please try to reproduce the bug before contacting me.

Things to do when i encountered a bug:

If a core-dump was created:
- start gdb with
   gdb hpt core
- type where
   where
- try to get all information out of the core file which could be interesting
  for me. (this is for people who are familiar with c-programming)

send me the following things:
- an extensive description of the situation where the bug happened.
- version of husky-software (stable version or date of checkout)
- your config-files
- all SMALL files hpt was using when the bug happened. (pkt's/dupe-files)
  only send me complete msgbases when the problem did not arise with a small
  one.
- a short description what system you are using.
  (OS - Distribution - compiler - etc. i do NOT need to know what kind of
  monitor do you use :-)

I prefer getting the things per fido crashmail to my boss (for what am i
hacking hpt? :-) ), but if you plan to send me your complete msgbase of one
year or you live not in germany, please use e-mail, because it will be cheaper for both of us..
